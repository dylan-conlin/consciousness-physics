# Consciousness Physics Tools

Practical implementations of The Conlin Equations.

## mode-detector.py

Detects whether consciousness is in Creation (Ã—R) or Transformation (/R) mode based on:
- Language patterns
- Energy levels  
- Time of day
- Context signals

```bash
python3 mode-detector.py
```

## physics-calculator.py

Calculates consciousness outcomes using The Conlin Equations:
- Input Pattern strength, Attention quality, and Reality/Resistance
- Get predicted consciousness outcome
- Receive optimization suggestions
- See real-world business and personal examples

```bash
python3 physics-calculator.py
```

## Why These Matter

These aren't just theoretical tools - they demonstrate how consciousness physics can guide:
- Daily work decisions
- Creative vs analytical task timing
- Project approach strategies
- Energy management
- Business applications

The equations work because they describe how consciousness actually operates.
